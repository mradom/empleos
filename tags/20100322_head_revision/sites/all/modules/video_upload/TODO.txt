List of to-do items for the video_upload module, in no particular order.
@todo tags can also be found distributed througout the code.

* Completely abstract out the Zend Gdata library so that this module
  could use a Drupal Youtube API module if it is ever built. The
  reason for this is that the Zend library requires modification of
  the PHP include_path variable, which can be hard for shared-hosting
  sites.

* Get the CCK widget to work with more than one video

* Abstract out the youtube specificity, so that this logic could apply
  to other providers

* Integrate the direct upload method available for the YouTube API:
  http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/developers_guide_php.html#DirectUpload
  This has been started. See the inline @todo items, and refer to the
  widget option 'use_browser_upload_method'.

* Make a 2 step form? Not sure if this is better. The advantages:
   - Collect all relevant info prior to submitting data to youtube
  The disadvantages:
   - it's a 2-step form, not sure how that would work with all CCK scenarios

* Make the form work w/o javascript.

* Allow for multiple YouTube accounts per site (or per field instance,
  etc).  The YouTube API limits uploads on accounts with more than
  1000 videos:

  http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/developers_guide_protocol.html#Uploading_Videos

* Implement the chromeless player functionality in a configurable way

  http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/chromeless_player_reference.html

* Clean up widget form behavior for single (ie, non-multiple) videos
  per field such that the form is hidden once a video is attached, and
  require the video to be deleted prior to adding a new video

* The cron jobs and video admin form break once a field is re-used in
  a different content type. These need to be fixed to use the cck API
  instead of custom queries.

* Handle the display of thumbnails, ideally hooking into emthumb
  module for override functionality

* Handle the selection of which thumbnail to use: YouTube provides 3
  thumbnails, which the user should be able to select from.

* The description that is sent/synchronized on YouTube should be able
  to pull from fields other than node->body. This should be
  configurable.

* When configuring a field, any known vocabularies should be presented
  as options for YouTube keywords

* Extend token support
